# 📬 Spam Message Detection using Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning-based system to detect spam messages using classification model.

❗ This project works well with this `dataset`. Using unrelated data may cause prediction errors.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from [mail_data.csv](mail_data.csv). 

It contains labeled messages as `spam` or `ham`.

---

## 🛠️ Features

- Data Preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, etc.)
- Feature Extraction using TF-IDF
- Model Training using:
  - Logistic Regression
- Performance Evaluation: Accuracy, F1 Score, Precision, Recall
- ROC Curve & Confusion Matrix
- Save/Load Model using `pickle`
